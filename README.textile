h1. Maître d'

Rack APIs powered by Grape for managing Heroku and Opperator add-ons. If used within a Rails application, it'll automatically be mounted as a Rails engine at the appropriate paths.

h2. Contributing

Contributions are very much welcome - but keep in mind the following:

* Keep patches in a separate branch.
* Write tests for your patches.
* Don't mess with the version or history file. I'll take care of that when the patch is merged in.
